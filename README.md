# Riemann problem solver
A wrapper for a pack of solvers for hydrodynamics, solid state physics problems.

The main goal of this project is to create a parser with 
a relatively simple and easy embedding of new solvers 
written in seminars.

In many(most) ways it is a playground for mastering the language and development tools/techniques.

Planned features:
- Docker
- Solvers reworked and translated from Python: WENO5 1D/2D, Chapman-Jouquet, SIMPLE 1D/2D, Godunov 1D/2D
- C++20 multithreading
- MPI
- Interactive scene builder
